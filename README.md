The steps into a more detailed, step-by-step format:

### Step 1: Frontend Setup

1. **Create Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Create a new directory for your project using the command: `mkdir project_name`.
   - Navigate into the project directory: `cd project_name`.

2. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Setup**:
   - Inside your project directory, create separate folders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files: `mkdir html css js`.
   - Create your HTML file(s) in the HTML folder: `touch html/index.html`.
   - Create CSS file(s) in the CSS folder: `touch css/style.css`.
   - Create JavaScript file(s) in the JavaScript folder: `touch js/script.js`.
   - Open your preferred code editor and start editing these files to build your frontend interface and functionality.

### Step 2: Backend Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - If not already installed, download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.
   - npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js installation.

2. **Initialize Node.js Project**:
   - In your terminal, navigate to your project directory if not already there.
   - Run `npm init` command and follow the prompts to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file.

3. **Install Express.js**:
   - Install Express.js framework using npm: `npm install express`.
   - This will add Express.js as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Create folders for different components of your backend (e.g., routes, controllers, models): `mkdir routes controllers models`.
   - Organize your backend code files accordingly within these folders.

5. **Database Setup**:
   - Install PostgreSQL on your system if not already installed.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database for your project.
   - Define your database schema including tables, columns, and relationships.

6. **Connect to PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Install `pg` package for PostgreSQL connectivity: `npm install pg`.
   - Set up database connection parameters in your Node.js backend code using `pg` library.

7. **Write Backend Code**:
   - Define routes, controllers, and models based on your application's functionality.
   - Set up CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the database.

8. **Start Node.js Server**:
   - Write code to create an Express.js server in your main backend file (e.g., `server.js`).
   - Start the server using `app.listen()` method.

### Step 3: Integrating Python

1. **Install Python**:
   - If not already installed, download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/.

2. **Write Python Scripts**:
   - Decide on the functionality you want to implement using Python.
   - Write Python scripts or modules for the desired functionality.

3. **Integration**:
   - Establish communication between Node.js backend and Python scripts using child processes, API endpoints, or message queues.
   - Use libraries like `child_process` or create HTTP endpoints in Node.js to interact with Python scripts.

### Step 4: Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing**:
   - Integrate frontend and backend components.
   - Test your application thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
   - Debug and fix any issues encountered during testing.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Choose a hosting provider for your application.
   - Set up hosting environment compatible with Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL.
   - Deploy your application following hosting provider's deployment instructions.
   - Monitor your deployed application and address any issues post-deployment.
